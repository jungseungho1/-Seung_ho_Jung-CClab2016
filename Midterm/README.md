Today, data is transmitted in forms that human senses cannot comprehend. This project aims to aid in unveiling the unseen data into information that we can digest.

Human senses cannot pick up electromagnetic waves. This cloud lights up, squeaks, and squeals in presence of electromagnetic wave/field.
