####Description:
With todayâ€™s overabundance of technology, we rely heavily on information transmitting in forms that are incomprehensible to human senses. This project aims to aid in unveiling the invisible data into information that humans can digest.

This is an Electromagnetic Weather Cloud. As human senses cannot pick up electromagnetic waves, the object translates the invisible electromagnetic field into a visual concept of weather that we are familiar with.
